### About Me
Hey, my name is Fabian Schwarz and I'm a PhD Candidate at the [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.saarland/).
My current research focus is on system security and the intersection between trusted computing and network security.
I'm also interested in virtualization-based system designs and software/hardware interactions (e.g., MMIO, DMA).

I'm the primary author of [SENG, the SGX-Enforcing Network Gateway](https://github.com/sengsgx) (USENIX Security '20).

My new research paper on [TrustedGateway: TEE-Assisted Routing and Firewall Enforcement Using ARM TrustZone](https://github.com/trugw) will soon be published as part of the RAID'22 proceedings.

Our most recent research paper on [FeIDo: Recoverable FIDO2 Tokens Using Electronic IDs](https://github.com/feido-token) will soon be published as part of the CCS '22 proceedings.
