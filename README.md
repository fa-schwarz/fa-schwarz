### About Me
Hey, my name is Fabian F. Schwarz, and I have been a PhD Candidate at the [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.saarland/) for the last couple or years.
I have successfully graduated at the 28th August 2024.
My research focus so far has been on the design of new system and network defenses based on confidential computing technologies---to be precise: trusted execution environments (TEEs).
I have practical experience with Intel SGX (user space TEE), Arm TrustZone (system-level TEE), and AMD SEV-SNP (trusted virtual machines), and have been responsible for the high-level design of a new RISC-V CPU extension (publication is pending).

A research paper on a RISC-V CPU security extension is currently under revision.
